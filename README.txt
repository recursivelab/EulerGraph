COMPILING

Compiling is possible by most C++ compilers.
To compile by GNU compiler type

g++ -oeuler euler.cpp

---------------------------------------------------------------------

USAGE

From command line You can use it by typing

./euler input_files

On Windows systems prefix "./" is needless. Type

euler input_files

If no input file is specified, then program expects input graph
from standard input.

Input format is:
Number of vertices
Adjacency of the first vertex to all vertices.
Adjacency of the second vertex to all vertices but first.
...
Adjacency of the last vertex to itself.

Example of input for complete graph of three vertices is:

3
0 1 1
0 1
0

Do not forget spaces!

Output gives path by vertices numbers where numbers starting by 0.

Example of output for complete graph of three vertices is:

0
1
2
